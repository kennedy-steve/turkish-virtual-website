Welcome to the Turkish Airlines Virtual Blog!

I'm Nate, and I'll help you get started with adding new posts so I'm not the only one around here.

Literally anyone can add make a post, you just need to go to [our Github Repository](https://github.com/kennedy-steve/turkish-virtual-website) Simply create a new branch, commit your changes, and submit a Pull Request. If you're not part of the Turkish Airlines Virtual team, you'll need to fork the repository and submit a Pull Request.

New to Git? Checkout out my [Git with the Flow Guide](https://www.tisuela.com/git-with-the-flow).

[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images, or you can just paste the image in on Github and Github will upload it for you. 

If you choose to create a blog post folder, simple title the folder as the `<date>-<title>` and add the post as `index.md` in the folder. Example is: `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`. 

The blog supports tags as well!

Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
